## Kotlin Spring Api Demo Application
This application is built for kotlin test API implementation.
I think it covers all requested assignment.

### Running application

#### Console:
To run application execute (dev profile default):

```./gradlew bootRun```

For prod profile:

```./gradlew bootRun -Pprod```

For dev profile:

```./gradlew bootRun -Pdev```

Was planning to do but had no time (will do if requested):

- Jacoco reports
- Sonarqube implementation
- Jenkins pipelines build
- Docker build
- Cloud deploy
